# FaB-Calendar
A simple calendar app that plots events for a single day. 
Experiments with HTML 5 boiler plate

Can be invoked by invoking 'layoutDay', from console, with a list of events.
ex. layOutDay([ {start: 30, end: 150}, {start: 540, end: 600}, {start: 560, end: 620}, {start: 610, end: 670} ])
